Mysql is a RDBMS or a DBMS, in these databases you will be able to store information and then be able to 
modify and retrieve it in different ways. it is that mysql is relational because the data within mysql is 
stored as an array also called table.tables are defined in two ways: the columns that are called fields 
here, these columns allow to identify the differences.


-Different data : the data you need to collect for an order is different from that of a customer.
-Duplicate data : every customer has a name, and every order also has a customer's name. The processing of 
this duplicate data becomes messy.
